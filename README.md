### Junior Software Developer ###

I am a Software Developer from Makers Academy. I graduated from the Harrodian School last year and will be on a Gap Year before starting an Engineering Science degree at Oxford University in October. I decided to take a gap year to develop my knowledge of software development and gain industry experience in a tech company.

Then a sentence about what you've achieved.

And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment. --> short-term (for 2 months)
